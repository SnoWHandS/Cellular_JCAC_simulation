# Joint Call Admission Control Algorithm (JCAC) simulaltion
The source code in this repository is used to simulate and test a Heterogeneous cellular network with the JCAC algorithm in use.
## Setup
The simulation code was written in python version 3 and as such must be executed with python 3.

## Execution
To run the simulation simply execute the python file with the following command at the bash terminal.
```bash
python JCAC.py
```
This will execute all the predefined tests and output their results into the output directory as csv files.
